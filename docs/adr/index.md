# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Tiered Mini Golf Course Blender project. Each ADR documents a significant technical decision made during the design and implementation of the 9-hole miniature golf course 3D model.

## Format

All ADRs follow the Markdown Architectural Decision Records (MADR) format:

- **Title** - Descriptive name of the decision
- **Status** - Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context** - The forces at play and the problem being addressed
- **Decision** - The chosen approach
- **Consequences** - Positive and negative outcomes of the decision
- **Alternatives Considered** - Other options that were evaluated
