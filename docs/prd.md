# PRD: Tiered Mini Golf Course - 9 Holes

## Project Overview

Design and build a 9-hole miniature golf course as a 3D model in Blender, suitable for construction planning and visualization. The course features a naturalistic landscaped design descending a hillside with creative obstacles including a signature windmill hole with loop.

## Physical Constraints

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Total footprint** | 15m x 10m (max, not all space required) |
| **Total elevation drop** | 3m (top to bottom) |
| **Layout** | Tiered/terraced descent down an incline |
| **Number of holes** | 9 |
| **Style** | Landscaped, naturalistic English garden aesthetic |
| **Surface** | Artificial turf putting green with natural stone borders |

## Design Principles

### Terrain & Tiering
- The course descends ~3m over 9 holes, averaging ~0.33m drop per hole
- Not all drops need to be equal - some holes can be flat, others can have dramatic drops
- Terraces connected by gentle ramps, steps, or cascading features
- Retaining walls using natural stone, timber sleepers, or gabion baskets
- Pathways between holes with non-slip surfaces

### Landscaping
- Planting beds between holes with low-maintenance shrubs, ornamental grasses, and seasonal flowers
- Feature trees (small ornamental) at key visual points
- Rock gardens and boulder clusters for natural feel
- Optional water features (small streams, ponds) integrated with course
- Ground cover plants on slopes between tiers
- LED accent lighting along pathways for evening play

### Playability Standards
- Hole lengths: 3m to 10m (measured along putting line)
- Green width: minimum 0.9m, typical 1.2m
- Border rails: 10cm height, rounded top edge
- Cup diameter: 108mm (standard)
- Par per hole: 2-4 strokes
- Total par: 27 (par 3 average)

## Hole Designs

### Hole 1: "The Welcome" (Par 2)
- **Tier**: Top level (elevation 0m, starting point)
- **Length**: 3.5m
- **Drop**: 0m (flat)
- **Description**: Straight introductory hole with gentle curved borders. Simple dog-leg right. Stone archway entrance feature.
- **Obstacles**: None (warm-up hole)
- **Landscaping**: Flower beds flanking entrance, welcome signage

### Hole 2: "The Cascade" (Par 3)
- **Tier**: Top to Tier 2 (drop 0.3m)
- **Length**: 5m
- **Drop**: 0.3m gentle slope
- **Description**: Gentle downhill slope with a slight S-curve. Ball rolls naturally downhill. Small cascading water feature alongside.
- **Obstacles**: Two bumper stones mid-fairway, narrowing chicane
- **Landscaping**: Cascading water feature (small waterfall), ferns, moss-covered rocks

### Hole 3: "The Bridge" (Par 3)
- **Tier**: Tier 2 (drop 0.3m)
- **Length**: 6m
- **Drop**: 0.3m (bridge spans a gully)
- **Description**: Elevated bridge section over a planted gully. Ball crosses a narrow wooden bridge with low side rails, then turns left to the green.
- **Obstacles**: Narrow bridge (0.6m wide), banked left turn
- **Landscaping**: Deep planted gully beneath bridge with ferns and mosses, stone retaining walls

### Hole 4: "The Spiral" (Par 3)
- **Tier**: Tier 2 to Tier 3 (drop 0.5m)
- **Length**: 7m
- **Drop**: 0.5m
- **Description**: A spiral descent around a central rocky mound. Ball follows a banked helical path descending around a feature rock garden.
- **Obstacles**: Banked spiral curve (270 degrees), central rock mound
- **Landscaping**: Alpine rock garden in center with succulents and alpine plants

### Hole 5: "The Windmill" (Par 4) -- SIGNATURE HOLE
- **Tier**: Tier 3 to Tier 4 (drop 0.5m)
- **Length**: 8m (longest hole)
- **Drop**: 0.5m
- **Description**: The signature hole. Players putt uphill onto a curved ramp that launches into a LOOP (vertical loop-de-loop, ~0.6m diameter). The loop exits directly into the windmill structure. The windmill has 4 rotating blades that periodically block the ball's path through the ground-level opening. Time your shot to pass through when the blade gap aligns. After the windmill, the ball descends a gentle slope to the green.
- **Obstacles**:
  - **Loop-de-loop**: Enclosed transparent tube/track, 0.6m diameter vertical loop
  - **Windmill**: Traditional Dutch-style windmill, 1.5m tall, 4 rotating blades (blade rotation period ~4 seconds). Ground-level opening (15cm wide) that blades sweep past to block/allow passage
  - Ball path: Tee -> uphill ramp -> loop -> windmill passage -> downhill to green
- **Landscaping**: Tulip beds around windmill base, small pond with reeds, Dutch-themed garden area
- **Animation**: Windmill blades rotate continuously. Blade tips pass at ground level blocking the opening.

### Hole 6: "The Tunnel" (Par 3)
- **Tier**: Tier 4 to Tier 5 (drop 0.4m)
- **Length**: 5.5m
- **Drop**: 0.4m
- **Description**: Ball enters a stone tunnel through an artificial hill. Inside the tunnel, a split path offers two routes - left (longer, safer) or right (shorter, riskier with a narrow gap). Both paths merge before the green.
- **Obstacles**: Stone tunnel with split paths, narrow gap on shortcut route
- **Landscaping**: Grass-topped hill over tunnel, wildflowers, butterfly garden

### Hole 7: "The Stepping Stones" (Par 3)
- **Tier**: Tier 5 (drop 0.3m)
- **Length**: 5m
- **Drop**: 0.3m
- **Description**: Ball crosses a series of raised stone "stepping stone" platforms over a shallow decorative pond. Each stone is a small flat putting surface connected by short ramps.
- **Obstacles**: 3 stepping stone platforms (0.5m diameter), water hazard (decorative, ball can't actually fall in - transparent walls)
- **Landscaping**: Shallow pond with water lilies, koi fish details, Japanese garden feel with small maple tree

### Hole 8: "The Ravine" (Par 3)
- **Tier**: Tier 5 to Tier 6 (drop 0.4m)
- **Length**: 6m
- **Drop**: 0.4m
- **Description**: A dramatic shot across a ravine. Ball launches off a ramp, crosses a gap (with catch net below), and lands on the green on the other side. For less adventurous players, an alternative winding path goes around.
- **Obstacles**: Ravine gap (0.5m), launch ramp, catch net/return system
- **Landscaping**: Deep ravine with planted sides, small stream at bottom, dramatic rock faces

### Hole 9: "The Grand Finale" (Par 3)
- **Tier**: Tier 6 to base level (drop 0.0m remaining, final green at bottom)
- **Length**: 6m
- **Drop**: 0.0m (final tier, flat finish)
- **Description**: Final hole with a celebration theme. Straight shot through a gauntlet of spinning obstacles (small pinwheel-style spinners on posts). Hole ends with the cup on a slightly raised platform with a flag. Bell/gong that rings when ball drops in (decorative detail).
- **Obstacles**: 4 pinwheel spinners on alternating sides, slightly raised final green
- **Landscaping**: Celebration garden with colorful flowers, final scorecard station, seating area

## Elevation Profile

```
Hole:  1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
       |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
Elev:  0.0  0.0  0.3  0.6  1.1  1.6  2.0  2.3  2.7  3.0
Drop:  0.0  0.3  0.3  0.5  0.5  0.4  0.3  0.4  0.0
       [flat][gentle slope  ][main drops    ][wind down ]
```

Total drop: 0.0 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.0 = 2.7m
(Remaining 0.3m used for pathway ramps between holes)

## Layout Strategy

The course follows a switchback/zigzag pattern down the incline:
```
  TOP (entrance)
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │  H1 ──► H2          │  Tier 1-2 (north end)
  │         │            │
  │  H4 ◄── H3          │  Tier 2-3
  │  │                   │
  │  H5 (WINDMILL) ──►  │  Tier 3-4 (center, widest area)
  │              │       │
  │  H7 ◄── H6  │       │  Tier 4-5
  │  │           │       │
  │  H8 ──► H9  │       │  Tier 5-6 (south end, base)
  └─────────────────────┘
  BOTTOM (exit/scoring)
```

Approximate footprint usage: ~13m x 9m (within the 15x10m envelope)

## Technical Requirements (Blender)

### 3D Model
- Full course modeled in Blender 5.0
- Realistic scale (1 Blender unit = 1 meter)
- PBR materials for all surfaces
- Geometry nodes for grass/vegetation where possible

### Rendering
- Outdoor natural lighting (sun + sky)
- Time of day: golden hour (warm, dramatic shadows)
- Camera positions: bird's eye overview, per-hole detail shots, eye-level walk-through
- Minimum render resolution: 1920x1080

### Deliverables
1. Blender file (.blend) with complete course
2. Rendered overview image (top-down and perspective)
3. Per-hole detail renders (9 images)
4. Windmill animation render (short video/GIF)
5. Camera flyover animation (optional)

## Success Criteria

- All 9 holes are modeled with correct relative positions and elevations
- The windmill is animated with rotating blades
- The loop-de-loop on Hole 5 is clearly visible and correctly shaped
- Landscaping elements (plants, rocks, water) are present
- The overall aesthetic is cohesive and naturalistic
- The course fits within the 15x10m footprint
- Total elevation drop is approximately 3m
